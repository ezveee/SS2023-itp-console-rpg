FIGHT-TUTORIAL (CONCEPT)

[PRE-TUTORIAL]
- king comes to player's town
- searches for "prophecied" person
- upon finding player, he tells them about the "prophecy",
	then tells the player that they have to fight a battle
	against one of his servants to prove their worth

[TUTORIAL]
- before start, player gets the chance to skip the tutorial
- fight starts, servant's abilities are based on player's class
	(i.e. if player chose to be a warrior, make servant a magician (???))
- player is launched into a fight, looks and plays like a typical fight
- maybe a little bit of text explaining hp and mp, the text itself shouldn't be
	too long though, max. one sentence per mechanic (learning by doing)
- player is allowed to choose what to do themself

// i prefer ver1, ver2 feels very patronizing
[TUTORIAL FIGHT VER 1]
- fight is losable
- if player loses the fight, they get the option to either retry or skip the tutorial
	altogether

[TUTORIAL FIGHT VER 2]
- fight isn't losable
- if player is at 1HP, enemy attacks always miss

[POST TUTORIAL]
- king is delighted with player's strength, tells them he wants them to help
	him find the relic he needs
- game officially starts
