THIS IS THE DIALOG IN THE BEGINNING, THE REST OF THE STORY IS
EXPLAINED THROUGHOUT THE FIRST PART OF THE GAME, DONT WORRY

{L"Mother", L"You wake up to sun rays shining through the window, directly in your face. Downstairs, you hear your mother clattering in the kitchen, preparing food. You get up and head downstairs.\n\nMother: Good morning [YOUR NAME], have you slept well? I hope I didn't wake you up. A letter came for you earlier today. It seems very important. The man delivering it said it was urgent and that it was to be read by no one but yourself.\n\nYou take the letter and break the seal at the back. The stamp was that of the king's royal emblem. You take out the paper, unfold it and start reading it:\n\n'To [YOUR NAME],\nEsteemed [YOUR NAME],\nI hope this letter finds you in good health. I request your presence at my castle in the grand city with great urgency as I have an important matter to discuss with you regarding your extraordinary lineage and most remarkable potential as the child of the great warrior who once fought by my side.\n\nShow this letter to the guards stationed in front of my castle. They will let you through.\n\nI implore you to heed my call and follow my invitation to my castle. I eagerly await your presence, [YOUR NAME], for the entire kingdom is dependent on your skill, as well as your bravery and valor.\n\nYours faithfully,\nthe King.'\n\nYou stare at the letter in disbelief. Your mother walks up next to you.\n\nMother: What is the letter about? You look pale as a sheet [Y/N].\n\nYou show your mother the letter, who gasps in disbelief.\n\nMother: Good heavens, the king wants you to fight alongside him, just like your father once did! You should get ready as soon as possible! You wouldn't want to make the king wait! Be on your way now, [Y/N]. I wish you safe travels!"},

THIS DIALOG IS FOR THE KING, IT UNLOCKS THE ACCESS TO AREA 2 AS WELL AS THE DUNGEON AND GIVES AN ALLY

{L"King", L"You enter the castle. The inside is just as intricately decorated as the outside, with not one speck of dust on the floor, the corners void of spiderwebs. The king is sitting atop his throne, looking pointedly at you as you take in your surroundings. You have never seen the king in person. All of your childhood, you've only heard stories of his greatness and seen paintings of his likeness. In person, he looks even more intimidating, each detail sharper than a painting could ever capture. As you approach the throne and kneel in front of him, he gets up and approaches you.\n\nKing: Stand up, [Y/N]. You've answered my call, a wise decision indeed. I hope your journey to my castle helped you train for what is to come as the journey that lies before you is even more treacherous than anything you've experienced before. Now, you might wonder why I have called you here, [Y/N]. It has to do with this.\n\nHe shows you an ancient scroll, the fragile parchment yellowed, signifying its old age.\n\nKing: The situation of this realm is dire. Once prosperous and thriving, it now teeters on the edge of ruin. Darkness threatens to engulf us, the fabric of the land is unraveling. This scroll tells of a way to stop the decay. It tells of an ancient artifact hidden somewhere in this very kingdom. I've sent many of my own strongest soldiers to search for it but in vain. I was about to give up any hope of finding it, when I once again picked up and read the scroll. In it, it mentions the child of a great warrior, a legendary [CLASS NAME] from the same renowned bloodline, who has the ability to find the artifact. That child is you, [Y/N]. I have fought alongside your father, I knew his extraordinary strength, his skill with the blade. I see that same potential in you. Now, are you ready to take on this quest, a treacherous task through the most forsaken places this kingdom has to offer? Your help will bring you a lifetime of glory.\n\nYou nod, signaling that you are ready to take on the quest bestowed upon you.\n\nKing: Very well, I am glad you will be of help to me. Before you set out, let me entrust you with one of my closest allies, a-\n\n"}

DIALOG FOR REBELLION GENERAL IN DUNGEON 1, UNLOCKS CITY 2

{L"Rebellion_General", Rebellion General: You are making a foolish decision, kid. The king is not your friend, he is our common enemy. A despicable man with deplorable intentions.\n\nYou think back to the folk living in the city. They seemed happy under the king's rule. 
It wasn't the king who just fought you. It was the Rebellion General. One part of a small group that could never be satisfied if it wasn't them who called the shots.\n\nRebellion General: He has gotten into your head and charmed you the way he charmed everyone else. Do not believe a word he says.\n\nYou do not believe a word the Rebellion General says.\n\nRebellion General: Very well, so be it. I cannot change your mind. But let me tell you, you will see the misery the king has left us in when you step out into the real world. The king's propaganda does not reach outside of the walls of the big city in the way he hopes
it does. Now go. What you search for is not here. What you search for is hidden away, impossible to find."},

His Highness, the king has sent me to talk you through the next part of your mission. He wants you to go out and search the dungeon in the area past this city.

DIALOG FOR REBELLION LEADER IN DUNGEON 2, UNLOCKS CITY 3

{L"Rebellion_Leader", L"Rebellion Leader: The king is fooling you, kid. Stop this search. We can protect you from the king's wrath. We will help you. The king should under no circumstances gain access to the artifact.\n\nThe king's intentions could not be that bad, could they? He is an honest man, putting the needs of his citizens before his own needs, mostly at least. The artifact will help him. It will lend him the strength to eliminate the struggles and worries of his folk once and for all.\n\nRebellion Leader: You do not understand the power you are toying with, kid. The king will use the artifact to subdue the dissatisfied and eradicate the ones who are brave enough to speak out about it. He has no remorse, no conscience. All he wants is to have more and more power. Join us, join our force, and help us defeat the king. With you and your allies on our side, we stand a chance to bring peace back to the country.\n\nThere is peace in the country. Why does the Rebellion Leader act as if there was not?\n\nRebellion Leader: Very well, it seems you won't change your mind. I will not try to persuade you further, but you are currently on the wrong side of history. I hope your journey through this land will open your eyes to that."},

STORY NPC HERE IS A GUARD WHO HANDS YOU A LETTER BY THE KING AT THE CITY ENTRANCE

{L"Guard", L"The guard outside of the city gates holds you up as you try to enter.\n\nGuard: Wait, kid. A message from the king has been delivered for you. It is urgent. I advise you to read it immediately.\n\nYou take the letter and open it up.\n\n'Esteemed [Y/N],\nAs you have most likely concluded by now, the artifact was not hidden away in this second dungeon either. Therefore it is most likely to hide in the last dungeon, a treacherous place just past this town.\n\nMake haste and search for it as soon as possible. The future of this very kingdom lies within your hands, you are advised to find it and return it to me as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\nthe King.'\n\nYou decide to go out to find it as soon as possible."},

FROM HERE ON OUT THE LAST AREA IS OPEN FOR EXPLORATION

THE LAST BOSS IS THE KING

{L"Dungeon_3_King", L"As you hold the artifact in your hands, you hear heavy footsteps behind you. Cradling it to your chest, you take out your weapon and point it in the direction of the sounds. From the shadows, the king emerges, a pleasant yet almost chilling smile on his face. He approaches you with opened arms. You lower your weapon.\n\nKing: Very well done, [Y/N]. Now, would you be so kind as to hand the artifact over? Your journey is over. It is time to bring peace back to the land and defeat those who oppose me once and for all.\n\nYou hesitate, not quite ready to hand over the artifact. The king's smile fades slightly.\n\nKing: Now, [Y/N], don't be foolish. Hand over the artifact. It is the only way to bring this country back to glory, the only way to regain control.\n\nAs he approaches you further, you take a step back. This angers the king, his smile now entirely replaced by a frown, his eyebrows knit together, a dark expression on his face. Yet, you can't shake what you've heard from citizens around the kingdom, you can't shake the talk of his injustices, his malevolence toward the common folk in favor of keeping the wealthy happy.\n\nKing: Give it to me, [Y/N]. You don't understand the immense power you are toying around with. You lack the competence to handle the artifact. Give it to me, or I have no choice but to take it from you with force.\n\nIn an instant, you know what the right thing to do is. You decide that there is no way that the king should have the artifact. You once again raise your weapon, pointing it directly toward the king's chest.\n\nKing: Very well, so be it. But do not expect to emerge from this battle alive."},

AFTER THAT THE LAST BOSS FIGHT COMMENCES

AFTER DEFEATING THE KING

{L"Post_Game", L"As the king lies before you on the floor, you gaze down at him. You realize that this is not the powerful, benevolent man he made himself out to be, but a pathetic shell of a man that used you to further his power. He let the kingdom fall apart as power was more important than the satisfaction of his citizens.\n\nKing: Hand it... over, [Y/N]. This is far... from over... I need it, NEED it. My power, my control... it's... it's leaving me... I need it... I have to secure my reign... I have to... use it... I have to... control anyone who dares to say something against me... I need it... Give it to me...\n\n[ALLY 1 NAME]: What shall we do with him now? Kill him?\n\n[ALLY 2 NAME]: No, that is the easy way out for him. He shall be incarcerated for the rest of his life, damned to think for eternity about his injustices toward the folk.\n\nYou store away the artifact inside a pocket. Together, your allies and you carried him back to the big city. You made sure the artifact was secure, protecting it and never letting it leave your vicinity. In the city, the now former king confessed to his crimes and was convicted to life in prison.\n\nThe throne, now vacant, was quickly handed over to someone else. At first, the folk wanted you to take over the throne as you were the one who saved them, but you turned down the offer, instead advocating for the now-former leader of the Rebellion to rule the country.\n\nUnder his rule, he made you and your allies his advisors. Peace and fulfillment returned to the country as the dire situation stabilized. The new king ensured that no voice went unheard.\n\nAll is well."},
